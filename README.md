# Janus

Janus is a hybrid engine for unified Live and Historical RDF Stream Processing, implemented in Rust.

The name "Janus" is inspired by the Roman deity Janus who is the guardian of doorways and transitions, and looks towards both the past and the future simultaneously. This dual perspective reflects Janus's capability to process both Historical and Live RDF streams in a unified manner utilizing a single query language and engine.
